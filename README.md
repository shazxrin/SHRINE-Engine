SHRINE Engine - SHazRIN's Experimental Engine.

This is my personal toy game engine to learn, explore and experiment on real time rendering. This game engine uses C++ and its modern features as much as possible.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg):
```
./vcpkg install glfw3:x64-windows glm:x64-windows glad:x64-windows assimp:x64-windows stb:x64-windows
```

2. Open .sln project in Visual Studio
